# MQL5-ForSpecialEvents


ForSpecialEvents - MT5 Hotkey Trading Assistant

ForSpecialEvents is a powerful Expert Advisor for MetaTrader 5 designed for manual, discretionary traders who require speed and precision, especially during high-volatility events like news releases, speeches, or market openings. It replaces slow mouse clicks with a fully customizable hotkey system for instant trade execution and management.

Key Features

‚ö° Instant Order Execution with automatic SL and TP: Place market buy/sell orders with a single key press, bypassing the standard order window. Also, it instantly adds SL and TP with each click trade!

üî¢ Multiple Lot Sizes: Configure up to four different lot sizes, each with its own dedicated buy and sell hotkey.

üõ°Ô∏è One-Key "Panic" Close: Instantly close all open positions on the current chart's symbol with a single, customizable hotkey.

üìà Dynamic Trailing Stop: Protect your profits with a robust trailing stop. Crucially, you can toggle it on or off in real-time with a hotkey without reloading the EA.

‚öñÔ∏è Collective Breakeven: With one key, move the Stop Loss of all open positions to the breakeven point of your most recently opened trade, locking in a risk-free position across the board.

‚öôÔ∏è Fully Customizable: Every hotkey, lot size, SL/TP level, and trade parameter is configurable through the EA's input settings.

Use Case

This EA is not an automated trading robot. It is a manual trading tool built for speed. During major news events (e.g., NFP, CPI, FOMC), the market can move hundreds of points in seconds. Clicking through menus is too slow and can lead to missed entries or poor prices. This tool allows you to execute and manage trades with keyboard shortcuts, keeping your focus entirely on the chart and price action.

IMPORTANT: Hotkeys will only work when the chart window the EA is attached to is the active window in MT5.

When active, the EA will display the current status of the Trailing Stop in the top-left corner of the chart.
